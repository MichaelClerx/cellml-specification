cellml-specification
====================

This repository will be used by the CellML editors to develop the CellML specification (starting with version 1.2). The content has been reworked to include an informal guide embedded within the normative specification text (in version 2.0).

If things work correctly, changes in this repository will be reflected over at: https://cellml-specification.readthedocs.org/.
